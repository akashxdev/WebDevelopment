        HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the backbone of web content, enabling the creation and structuring of documents for the World Wide Web.
        Developed by Tim Berners-Lee, HTML uses tags to define elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links.
        It serves as the fundamental language for building websites, allowing developers to organize and present information seamlessly.
        HTML documents consist of a head and body, with the former containing meta-information and the latter housing the visible content.
        Together with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity, HTML forms the core trio empowering the dynamic and visually appealing nature of modern web pages.
